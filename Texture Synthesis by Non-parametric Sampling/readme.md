# Implementation of Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling <sup>1</sup>
<pre>
Python implemenation of the classic approach Texture Synthesis of Efros & Leung. 
An input image is taken, a feature from that image is removed, and the texture synthesis algorithm fills that
'hole' with the background texture.

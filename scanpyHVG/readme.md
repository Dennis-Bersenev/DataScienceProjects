A demo of the standard Seurat pipeline to identify marker genes, along with some simple Pearson-correlation comparison functions and scatter plots.<br/>
Also, a run through of the demo provided by the Yosef lab in their 'Hotspot' paper to identify 'informative' gene modules.
(DeTomaso, David, and Nir Yosef. “Hotspot Identifies Informative Gene Modules across Modalities of Single-Cell Genomics.” Cell Systems 12, no. 5 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2021.04.005.)

Both use the PBMC dataset provided by 10x genomics.
